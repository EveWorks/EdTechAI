# Alinda by Eve Works: A Case Study in Innovation & Resilience

## Overview
Alinda was created to be the future of personalised learning, AI teaching and academic integrity.

## Background & Context
This project was originally commissioned as a private endeavor. Due to unforeseen circumstances and a lack of communication regarding payment, we have decided to make it public. Rather than let this experience go to waste, we are turning this into a learning opportunity—a case study that showcases our technical expertise and the lessons learned in business.
